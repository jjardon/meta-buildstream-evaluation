# TODO This needs to be converted to a BuildStream plugin of its own kind
#      This is an incredibly ugly hack.

# First, we're hacking in an automatic dependency to the CMake host tool
build-depends:
  (>):
    - components/host/cmake.bst

# Second, CMake needs to set %{make} and %{make-install} a bit differently.
# See https://github.com/apache/buildstream-plugins/blob/master/src/buildstream_plugins/elements/cmake.yaml
# So, for any cross-compiled CMake apps, need to override those two vars:
variables:
  make: cmake --build %{build-dir} -- ${JOBS}
  make-install: env DESTDIR="%{destdir}" cmake --build %{build-dir} --target install
