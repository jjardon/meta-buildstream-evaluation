# Global overrides for certain element kinds:
elements:
  # TODO: See components/host/firmware-utils.bst, a component that uses CMake.
  #       CMake elements cannot currently auto-add the host tool cmake dependency.

  #           https://github.com/apache/buildstream/issues/1769
  #       Ideally, it should work like the commented bit below.
  #       However, all 'cmake' elements need to manually add right now. Not ideal.

  # Autotools plugin is broken when trying to do out-of-tree builds.
  # See upstream issue: https://github.com/apache/buildstream-plugins/pull/29
  # Attempt fix, revert to 1.95.1 behavior, which is preferable for us:
  autotools:
    variables:
      build-dir: "."
      configure: "%{build-root}/configure %{conf-args}"
